## Details for teaching team
I used two vendor packages for this app: "badcow/lorem-ipsum" and "randomuser/generator". I had some initial trouble getting the lorem-ipsum package working, until I realized I had made a typo in the code to use the package - it was an easy fix!
randomuser was a little trickier - my initial output was just an array of user info. It took me some time (and searching online) to figure out how to display it as a list.
Once I got going on this project, I realized the usefulness of Lavarel and how quick and clean it can make building applications!

## Outside code
